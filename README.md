# Rustlings Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) exercises, which I completed while reading "The Rust Programming Language" book.

Rustlings is a collection of small exercises designed to get you used to reading and writing Rust code. Each exercise focuses on a specific aspect of the language and often requires you to fix, implement, or refactor some code.
